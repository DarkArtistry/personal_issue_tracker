## Project Summary

For this project, you will be building an **issue tracker app**. The purpose of the app is for the user to track issues of a software project. The user of this app should be able to:

- **Create** a new issue by filling up a form that contains issue title (text field), issue type (select field), and issue description (textarea).
- **Edit** issue title, type, and description.
- **Close** and **Reopen** an issue.
- **View list** of all issues.
- **Change the order** of items in the list of issues.
- **View a chart** of open issues count by issue type.

User would typically add new issues, make changes, and close some issues. The chart will be useful for the user to know how many open issues for the different issue types (bug, improvement, question).

## Design

Functionality is the top priority but we also value good design. Overall the experience of using the app should be fluid and positive to the user. You have complete freedom for the styling.

The user should perform all of these actions in a **single view**. We would recommend the layout below. It is not necessary to create multi “pages” or “views” for this project.

Any changes on the page should be live and reactive, and does not require page refresh.
